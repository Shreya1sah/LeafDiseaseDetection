## Motivation

Plant diseases cause significant losses in agriculture worldwide. Detecting diseases early—preferably through image-based automated solutions—can help farmers take timely action. This project supports such efforts by offering a lightweight, repeatable framework for leaf-disease classification.

## Features

- 🔍 **Preprocessing pipeline** with resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- 🧠 **Custom CNN** (or transfer learning) implementation
- 🧪 **Model training** with validation and checkpointing
- 📊 **Evaluation scripts** for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- 🖼️ **Visualization modules** for displaying sample predictions
